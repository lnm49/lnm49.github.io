			<h2>Context</h2>
			<article>
				<p>The country of Colombia has suffered due to violence from guerrilla groups and economic hardships for an extensive amount of time. Eliminating these violent groups would be a major stepping stone to solving other important issues my country needs help in. The peace initiative began in 2012 with ex-president Juan Manuel Santos. It’s also a subject that has people extremely divided in Colombia. The Colombian government and leftist Farc rebels are working to solve over 50 years of conflict.</p>

			<h2>First Approach</h2>
			<article>
				<p>After the first deal was signed during Santos presidency, the JEP ( Justicia Transicional para la Paz ) is a special justice made for the peace deal and it deals with giving the people signing the deal a much more lenient and forgiving sentence for having signed it. In this moment, there are over 13,000 guerrilla members linked in the signing, with a big portion still not complying or accepting the agreement. The FARC haven’t complied with compensating the victims of their crimes as the accord has stated. The JEP magistrates are currently opening the processes on the different crimes committed by the Farc. Then the Truth Commission, ( La Commission de la Verdad ) must hear both sides and each of their versions of the wars. The government is fulfilling all protocols for job opportunities, housing, and rebuilding life. There was a vote for the acceptance of the agreements and the country voted No to peace by a tiny margin. The president then continued with the peace treaty and signed anyways. That has created a lot of division. The guerrilla group leaders have now transitioned into politics, including the president of the senate who is from the FARC.</p>

			<h2>Opportunities</h2>
			<article>
				<p>The peace agreement was not perfect, a lot of mistakes were made and a lot of citizens were not happy with the results. But the Colombian people learned that the only way to make peace is to guarantee truth, justice, reparation and non-repetition to prevent more victims and violence in Colombia. To do so, the guerrillas had to communicate with the victims, the government had to provide security and give opportunities to the guerillas to be part of the society and to be able to make a decent life with this opportunity. To make peace in Colombia, the entrepreneurs and the society in general need to make a big effort to forgive and to provide opportunities to the guerrillas. Some of the top leaders of the guerillas continued doing drugs business and some of the other members and social leaders were killed after the peace agreement was signed but we can say that the majority, about 13,000 young men and women soldiers, had the chance and the opportunity to start a new life aways from the weapons and violence of the drug business. Colombia is struggling to continue the peace process and with the help of the international community and the Colombian society we will be able to complete the process successfully and be an example for the rest of the world.</p>
